# Memory-Hacking
**Level:** Intermediate

To those interested in injecting to processes and reading from or writing to memory inside an application, here are 2 files written many many years ago when I was new to the scene.  
I don't recall the site I was given to learn from and do this test but it most definitely gave me an idea of what to expect so shoutout to the guy who created that tutorial years ago.

### NOTE:  
Hacking is never easy. Therefore, I made it a little challenging for you.  
You are given 2 open source completed files. Your goal is to set up the environment in order to be able to run and test this application for learning.

If you want to learn and dive deeper, do your research!!!

### Good luck!
